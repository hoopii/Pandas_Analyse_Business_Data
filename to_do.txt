to do pandas: 

- put in description of columns for datasets; description of variables 
- check notebooks (again) 
	--> comment out code and interpret results graphs
	--> think about using my own cleaned files 
	--> adapt our presentation
    --> look again at graph which shows discount status on total price(143)
    --> error in first graph under Exploring Revenue over time (164)
- Write Readme file
- do further analysis: 
        --> Show evolution for the amount of orders in different states (i.e. completed, cancelled etc...) for each month. Each state 
        should have it's own line in different color
