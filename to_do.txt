to do for update repository: 
 
- write Readme File
- put in description of columns for datasets; description of variables 
- check notebooks (again) 
	--> comment out code and interpret results and graphs
	--> https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/ (Guide on how to document my code)

	--> clean the code:
		- https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/ (PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code) 
		- indentation 
		- functions
		- etc.
	--> make better visualizations: 
		- Make them interactive: https://towardsdatascience.com/get-interactive-plots-directly-with-pandas-13a311ebf426
		- Make them more baeatiful with seaborns colour palettes
- do further analysis: 
	  --> Analysis on discount
        --> Show evolution for the amount of orders in different states (i.e. completed, cancelled etc...) for each month. Each state 
        should have it's own line in different color
- adapt our presentation and put it in repository to show skills of storytelling
