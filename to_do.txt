to do for update repository: 
 
- write Readme File
- put in description of columns for datasets; description of variables 
- check notebooks (again) 
	--> comment out code and interpret results and graphs
	--> clean the code: 
		- indentation 
		- functions
		- etc.
- do further analysis: 
	  --> Analysis on discount
        --> Show evolution for the amount of orders in different states (i.e. completed, cancelled etc...) for each month. Each state 
        should have it's own line in different color
- adapt our presentation and put it in repository
